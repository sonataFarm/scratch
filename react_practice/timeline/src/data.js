    title: 'How I Survived ISIS',
    body: 'Nearly three years later, the terror lockdown has taken its toll on Mosul’s civilians; Iraqi forces rallied to liberate the city last October, but the situation remains deadly. At press time the massive liberation operation was still inching along, with U.S. air support, winning block by block even as ISIS soldiers staked themselves out in people’s yards, using the families as human shields. When photojournalist Erin Trieb, 35, arrived in Mosul for Glamour in mid-March, neighborhoods were erupting in gunfire, and bombs screamed from the sky. Residents were terrified that ISIS would come back and retaliate. But Trieb wanted to know what it felt like for women to taste their first moments of freedom. “These women’s stories were so much more harrowing than I expected,” she says. “They had hit rock bottom, were starving to death, traumatized. And yet, defiantly, they survived.” Here she tells the stories of three women just beginning to enjoy their independence.'

    title: "The Shining Isn't Scary",
    body: "Before making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick had directed the 1975 film Barry Lyndon, a highly visual period film about an Irish man who attempts to make his way into the British aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with Barry Lyndon's lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading The Shining.\""
